Bootstrapped with 'create react-app --typescript'.

## Initial Layout Thoughts

The sidebar in the mockup implies the title, search input, and
breed buttons will scroll out of view, so I want to change
this so these elements have a fixed position.

If there's time, I'll ensure the button layouts look ok on mobile.
